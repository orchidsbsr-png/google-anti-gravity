# Product Images Folder

Please upload your product images to this folder with the following naming convention:

## Image Naming Rules

Name your images exactly as the product names (case-sensitive) or use these specific names:

- `Red Apples.jpg` (or .png, .webp, etc.)
- `Orange Persimmons.jpg`
- `Fuzzy Kiwis.jpg`
- `Peaches.jpg`
- `Plums.jpg`
- `Premium Asian Pear.jpg` (or `Pears.jpg`)

## Supported Formats
- .jpg / .jpeg
- .png
- .webp
- .gif

## Examples
- `Red Apples.jpg`
- `Peaches.png`
- `Fuzzy Kiwis.webp`

The app will automatically detect and use these images. If an image is not found, it will fall back to online placeholder images.

## Quick Start
1. Take photos of your fruits or download product images
2. Name them exactly as shown above (matching the product names)
3. Place them in this folder (`public/images/products/`)
4. The app will automatically use them!
